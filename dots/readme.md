# ****What is this?****

Yes, windows can actually be customized, believe it or not

You'll need to install a few apps to get it all working, and then accordingly adjust the config files to match your preferences, setup and username on windows (komorebi and whkd)

Once you're done setting up the files and apps, it's just drag and drop onto the root of C:\

Instructions
0. Install Scoop
1. Install Flow Launcher
2. Install Komorebi via scoop
3. Install WHKD via scoop
4. Install AHK (AutoHotKey)
5. Install Python via exe or scoop
6. Install Alacritty, oh-my-posh, ripgrep, fastfetch, bat, less, git, and neovim via scoop
7. Install Lazyvim/Nvchad (requires git and mingw-32/mingw-64, also only for alacritty)
8. Accordingly, adjust the Komorebi.json, whkdrc, and yasb files to fit your preferences/setup and username, since it by default uses beezity as the username (my username obviously)
